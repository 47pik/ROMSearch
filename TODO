----LIST OF THINGS NEEDING TO BE DONE----

- Implement a visual representation of save data
	- overall completion ratings

- Ensure rotation of device still allows app to function correctly, or block rotation functionality

- Improve the activity_display_exhibit.xml, popup_view.xml and item_info_view.xml layouts
	- add backgrounds
	- add texture
	- make grid stand out more
	- make clearer what users are supposed to do

- Improve the activity_main.xml layout
	- make clearer what users are supposed to do

- Fix bugs
	- Savedata error when recreating an activity
	- Pressing back button at bottom of screen doesn't update 		savedata upon return to MainActivity
	- Rotated exhibit activity scrolls only the savedata overlay, 		not the background images
